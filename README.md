### Intro
Experienced AI Engineer | LLM Specialist | Optimization Expert

With 5 years of hands-on experience across diverse AI domains, I specialize in developing optimized solutions that balance technical innovation with practical implementation. 

My recent work has focused on AI-driven image pre-translation pipelines, where I successfully reduced translation and OCR costs by 96% and 75% respectively while improving pipeline inference speed by 20%.

My engineering philosophy extends beyond coding: I believe development means finding the most appropriate solution to any problemâ€”whether that's elegant code or a strategic process change. This approach guided me in developing a Korean small Language Model (sLLM) that reduced VRAM requirements by 43% and training time by 51%, and in creating an on-device abnormal behavior detection solution for Samsung Display that achieved 97% facial recognition accuracy while reducing memory usage by 90%.

I thrive in collaborative environments where technical excellence meets practical business outcomes, constantly seeking the optimal path between theoretical possibilities and implementable solutions.

Open to discussing AI optimization challenges, Agentic LLM applications, and breakthrough approaches in computer vision and NLP.
