# Hyeongmin Moon 👋

## 🧠 About Me
Experienced AI Engineer specializing in optimization, LLMs, and computer vision. I believe development is about finding the most appropriate solution—whether elegant code or strategic processes.

My recent work has focused on AI-driven image pre-translation pipelines, where I successfully reduced translation and OCR costs by 96% and 75% respectively while improving pipeline inference speed by 20%.

I thrive in collaborative environments where technical excellence meets practical business outcomes, constantly seeking the optimal path between theoretical possibilities and implementable solutions.

## 🚀 Recent Achievements
- 🔍 **Image Pre-Translation Pipeline**: Reduced translation costs by 96%, OCR costs by 75%, improved inference speed by 20%
- 🤖 **Korean Small LLM (sLLM)**: Decreased VRAM usage by 43%, training time by 51%
- 👁️ **On-Device Security Solution for Samsung Display**: Achieved 97% facial recognition accuracy with 90% less memory

## 💡 Recent Interests

## 🌟 Philosophy
Development happens beyond computers. When faced with a problem, I choose the most effective solution—whether it's code or real-world action. This approach guided me in developing the Korean small Language Model (sLLM) and creating the on-device abnormal behavior detection solution for Samsung Display.
